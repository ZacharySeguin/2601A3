Instructions for testing: 
    1) Open the project in XCode and run it
    2) Once the emulator has loaded, toggle the ai to be on with the switch provided
    3) Click on the start button and select a square to place an X (player always starts)
    4) If you do not play within 2 seconds, the AI will play for you
    5) The AI also has basic blocking and winning functions built in, make a row of 2 X's and watch as the AI blocks your third and final move (Does not always work becauses AI might be trying to win)'
    6) If you wish to stop the game at any time, click on the stop button, clicking start again will reset all moves that were made as well. 
    7) To check if the unit test is working simply click on the "Product" tab and click on "Test" this will run the unit testing portion of the app which verifies that all of the game logic is functionning normally, test results will be displayed in the console window at the bottom of the IDE window.
